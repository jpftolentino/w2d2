HOW TO NODE EXPRESS W2D2

--Expressjs/guide web page (make sure to read the document thoroughly)

- install express
-> npm install express (Install express Library)

- declare express libraries and create a constant of express variable
-> const express = require('express');
-> const app = express();

--> learn what app.get does and what the functions argument's are used for

--> Node monitor tool that automatically restarts when the content of the file is changed

--> Create a `views` directory in root of webserver folder and you can add all of your images into one file and
references them locally. ----- ejs files are html templates

app.set("view engine","ejs");

app.get('/motreal', function(req, res) {
  res.render('motreal'); //go tot he vies folder and look for a file called montreal
})

app.get('/city/:someCity', function(req, res) {
  console.log('New city: ', req.params.someCity);
  res.send('Comming to this city soon...');
})


-----------HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR CODE BASED ON THE WEBSITES NEEDS AND HOW YOUR SERVER BEHAVES-------------------------------
RESTful API -- create servers when client requests for a certain resource

--> I have a website running on Digital Ocean, do I need to install express.js in the root directory of the server ?

--> WHAT IS USER AGENT ?!?!

//MORE NOTES

Template Literals & String Inerpolation

var name = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello', ${name}!`); //note the back ticks

let = var
var - creates a variable scoped within its nearest parent function
let - scopes the variable to the nearest block
const --- const in C++/C

--> Backend - the ones who determine what happens when a client makes a request... Essentially we're anticipating what the client will request for and handling the request
